My coding projects from C++ and Java (Intro and AP) classes at SLUH.
I also made various projects in Scratch throughout elementary and middle school, many of which were featured on the home page. Each has a "See Inside" button that gives you access to the code. My profile can be accessed here: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/pixelman2/
